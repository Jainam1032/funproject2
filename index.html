I can't imagine my life without you by my side.I had always prayed to god to have best for me and my family and I honestly think you are the result of it.You were with me always in my good times and especially in my hard times....and I can never forget that.I can't even describe in words how important you are for me,I hope you get that.And also you know how bad I am at this things.But please dont ever judge me on this as I will keep trying to get better at these things. I will always try my best to keep you and your family the happiest.I have been thinking much more than this in my mind pann yrrr I dont know how to describe it:(.So here is my lamest/dumbest try to have a smile on your facee meetuuuuuu. </p>
